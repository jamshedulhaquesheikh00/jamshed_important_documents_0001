Here is the blueprint of the General E-commerce website.

Iâ€™m thrilled to share the progress Iâ€™ve made on Day 1 of the Hackathon, where Iâ€™m building an E-Commerce Marketplace for Shirts! ðŸ‘•
Hereâ€™s how Iâ€™ve laid the foundation for my project:

Step 1: Choosing the Marketplace Type
After evaluating several options, I decided to focus on a General E-Commerce Marketplace dedicated to shirts. The goal is to create a platform where customers can easily find high-quality, stylish shirts across various categories like Casual, Formal, and Partywear.

Step 2: Defining Business Goals
âœ” Problem Solved: Many shoppers struggle to find affordable, trendy shirts in one place. My marketplace will bridge this gap by offering a curated selection with customization options.
âœ” Target Audience:
Young professionals looking for polished, formal shirts.
Style enthusiasts seeking fashionable casual wear.
Budget-conscious customers valuing affordability and quality.
âœ” What Sets It Apart:
Customization: Customers can personalize their shirts (e.g., size, color, style).
Affordability: Competitive pricing to suit everyone.
Fast Delivery: 2-day delivery for urban areas.

Step 3: Designing the Data Schema
Iâ€™ve outlined the core structure of my marketplace by identifying key entities and their relationships:
Products (ID, Name, Price, Stock, Category, Tags)
Orders (Order ID, Customer Info, Product Details, Status, Timestamp)
Customers (Customer ID, Name, Contact Info, Address, Order History)
Delivery Zones (Zone Name, Coverage Area, Assigned Drivers)
Shipment (Shipment ID, Order ID, Status, Delivery Date)
