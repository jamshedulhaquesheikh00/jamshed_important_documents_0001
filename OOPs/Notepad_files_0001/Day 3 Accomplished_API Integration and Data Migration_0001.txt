Today marks another milestone in my e-commerce marketplace project, where I successfully integrated APIs and migrated data into Sanity CMS. By enabling seamless API integration, I fetched and displayed product and category data dynamically in Next.js, ensuring real-time updates for a smooth user experience.

🔍 Key Achievements:

API Integration: Fetched and displayed product and category data dynamically.
Data Migration: Aligned schemas and validated fields in Sanity CMS for a scalable backend system.
Error Handling: Implemented techniques to manage API failures and maintain a seamless experience.
Followed modular coding principles and clean schema validation best practices, gaining insights into precise data handling and scalability.
Reflecting on today’s progress, I’m excited to tackle upcoming challenges and continue building towards a fully functional marketplace.
